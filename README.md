# Theme:
Country Segmentation Analysis of Development and Developed Countries by World Development Indicators

# Overview & Dataset:
The World Development Indicators (WDI) contains metrics to show the development performance of a country in years. This WDI statistical data is very useful to know the reason why a country is said to be developed or still a developing country.
The World Development Indicator includes the following sectors, namely:
  Health
  Education
  Environment
  Infrastructure
  Economics and Finance
  Social

# Objective:
Focuses on the Indonesian Severe Food and Undernourishment Population, utilizing the analysis of data from the World Development Indicators (WDI) specifically related to the healthcare sector between 2015 and 2019. The objective of this project is to examine the prevalence of severe food insecurity and undernourishment in Indonesia during this time period and gain insights into the challenges faced by the population in accessing adequate nutrition.

# Result:
Based on data from the World Development Indicators, malnutrition and severe food insecurity in Indonesia have continued to decline over the past five years (2015 - 2019). In 2019, the undernutrition index stood at 6.5% of the total population. In addition, in the same year, the severe dietary index of a population stood at 0.7% of the total population.

These declining conditions indicate that Indonesia is starting to meet the nutritional and nutritional needs of its citizens from year to year. However, fast-moving globalization also makes foreign food brands that fall into the junk-food category begin to circulate in Indonesia. It is possible that the condition of lack of nutrition and nutrition that is balanced and good for the body is again widespread.

Therefore, it is necessary to create new movements and programs to support the reduction of malnutrition and severe food deficiencies in a population in Indonesia. One of them is by creating a business in the health sector by utilizing digital facilities, HealFoody.

HealFoody is a company that provides a health and nutrition consulting service and provides healthy food or drinks according to consumers' health and nutrition conditions. With HealFoody, it is expected to help reduce the number of malnutrition in Indonesia within the next five years.
